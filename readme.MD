# Advanced Settings for Jetpack
 
This little plugin adds links to the old full module list in your dashboard. It is most likely not useful for the majority of Jetpack users, but may come handy to some site builders.

Right now it adds 2 links:

- A new Jetpack submenu item linking to the old Module list.
- A new menu item in the Jetpack dashboard.

## Why is this not in Jetpack itself?

Jetpack's interface has changed a lot in the past few releases. You can learn more about those changes [here](https://jetpack.com/2017/04/04/settings-overhaul-redesign/). You can also comment on the post to give feedback to the developers, or open an issue in the Jetpack GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/Automattic/Jetpack/issues/new).
